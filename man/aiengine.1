.SH NAME
aiengine \- AIEngine is a packet inspection engine with capabilities of learning without any human intervention
.SH SYNOPSIS
aiengine --help
.SH DESCRIPTION
AIEngine helps network/security profesionals to identify traffic and develop signatures for use them on NIDS, Firewalls, Traffic classifiers and so on.
AIEngine system is based on c++11
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-input\fR
Sets the network interface, pcap file or directory with pcap files.
Sets the pcap file or directory with pcap files to analyze.
.PP

Link Layer optional arguments.
.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-tag\fR
Selects the tag type of the ethernet layer (vlan,mpls).
.PP

TCP optional arguments.
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-tcp-flows\fR
Sets the number of TCP flows on the pool. 32768 flows is the default value.
.PP

UDP optional arguments.
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-udp-flows\fR
Sets the number of UDP flows on the pool. 16384 flows is the default value.
.PP

Regex optional arguments.
.TP
\fB\-R\fR, \fB\-\-enable-signatures\fR
Enables the Regex engine. This implies that all the payloads of the flows will be process by this engine.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-regex\fR
Sets the regex for evaluate agains the flows..
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-flow-class\fR
Uses tcp, udp or all for matches the signature on the flows.
.PP

Frequencies optional arguments.
.TP
\fB\-F\fR, \fB\-\-enable-frequencies\fR
Enables the Frequency engine. This implies that all the payloads of the flows will be process by this engine.
.TP
\fB\-g\fR, \fB\-\-group-by\fR
Groups frequencies by src-ip,dst-ip,src-port and dst-port. 
src-ip stands for source IP address.
dst-ip stands for destination IP address.
src-port stands for source port (UDP or TCP).
dst-port stands for destination port (UDP or TCP).
Also the parameter could be a combination of src-ip,src-port or dst-ip,dst-port.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-flow-type\fR
Selects the flows process by the Frequency engine by using the protocol (TCP or UDP).
.TP
\fB\-L\fR, \fB\-\-enable-learner\fR
Enable the Learner engine in order to analyze the frequencies generated by the Frequency engine.
.TP
\fB\-k\fR, \fB\-\-key-learner\fR
The Learner engine needs a key for analyze the flows that have been process by the Frequency engine.


.PP
Optional arguments.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-stack\fR
Selects the Network stack for the analysis. There is only two network stacks availables at the moment. The Stack Lans contains the configuration of a LAN network (ethernet,ip,tcp,udp), and the Stack mobile contains a 3G stack (ethernet,ip,udp,gprs,ip,udp,tcp). 
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-dumpflows\fR
Dumps the flows processes to the stdout.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-statistics\fR
Shows details of statistics of every object plugged to the stack. There is 5 levels of statistics level.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-pstatistics\fR
Shows process statistics, such as memory comsumption, context switching, and so on.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
display this help and exit
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
output version information and exit
